# 03 JavaScript: Password Generator

In this challenge we were asked to add to the code from the password generator. When the button is clicked the user should be asked to put in the amount of characters for the password. if the amount was between 8 and 128 then the password generator would ask if the user wanted uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers and special characters in their password. The user had to choose at lease one option or the user would be asked to choose again. once the criteria is chosen then the password is generated.

I look on the internet for some examples and found that the easiest way for me to do this would be to put everything in one huge function. first the user chooses the length. then the function for getPassword goes through all the criteria we need to meet and puts it in an array. after that I used some math to generate the alphabet, numbers and symbols from the ascii table and then output a random choice. I really enjoyed this code!
